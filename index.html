        <p>Cities are constantly improving their technology infrastructure to keep pace with the modern world. Data has become the single most important decision making tool that helps our local governments make better choices on urban planning and infrastructure development based on evidence to benefit our communities.</p>
        <p>Hack NTX is a hackathon aimed at supporting cities and communities across North Texas who are investing and researching in new ways to improve the lives of everyday citizens through technology. This event is a chance for those passionate about civic technology, government transparency, and open data to utilize their skillsets in building applications, tools, and prototypes that support smart city initiatives.</p>

           <h4 class="card-title">What’s a hackathon?</h4>
           <p>A hackathon is a creative marathon all about building cool things. Participants listen to organizations present their problems, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in 24 hours. We take these civic issues and smart city concepts and combine it with technology to make something impactful. It's a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.</p>
