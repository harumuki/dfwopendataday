  Don't bring any firearms, knives, weapons, drugs, or alcohol. Don't use an old
  project - start a new trail instead! Also, please read our Rules. Organizers
  will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from
  all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody (TL;DR be
  nice).
