title: What is Open Data Day?
body: >-
  Open Data Day is a gathering of citizens to write applications, liberate data,
  create visualizations and publish analyses using open public data to show
  support for and encourage the adoption of municipal open data policies. It is
  a great opportunity for college students and local developers to use open data
  from cities around North Texas to produce something useful to their own
  communities.
