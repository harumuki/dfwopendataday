title: Whatâ€™s a hackathon?
content: >-
  A hackathon is a creative marathon all about building cool things.
  Participants listen to organizations present their problems, form teams, and
  then build out that idea into a product in a day. We take these civic issues
  and smart city concepts and combine it with technology to make something
  impactful. It's a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.
