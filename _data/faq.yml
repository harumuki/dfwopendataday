- title: Whatâ€™s a hackathon?
  content: A hackathon is a creative marathon all about building cool things. Participants listen to organizations present their problems, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in a day. We take these civic issues and smart city concepts and combine it with technology to make something impactful. It's a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.
