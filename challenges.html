		<p>We're all citizens in the cities we live in. When we go out to drive, shop, eat, drink, or even in our own homes and neighborhoods - we sometimes encounter issues of our own that could be fixed or improved. These can vary wildly in implementation and effort. For example:</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>We see a big pothole in a road - but how can we report it?</li>
				<li>People seem to be complaining about air quality but our city isn't addressing it, but maybe we can capture some of our own samples to collect more data.</li>
				<li>It's difficult to find my trash pickup times for our neighborhood - can we make that easier to find?</li>
				<li>Our downtown area doesn't have public wifi - what are the obstacles to address that?</li>
				<li>How can we find out about the construction projects that are going on around our city?</li>
				<li>Can we use open data to correlate accidents to intersections to fix the most dangerous ones?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The number of ideas that could be worked on are limitless, but you should try and find something you're passionate about, or even find interesting as a technology solution. Could we build a chatbot based on data scraped from a city website? If you find chatbots and data scraping interesting - then this is the project for you!</p>
		<p>But we do want to encourage you to pitch your own idea. Click the button below to add your own idea to the list below!</p>
