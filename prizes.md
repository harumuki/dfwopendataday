## But why are we here?!

Aren't we here to put our collective experience and brainpower together to support civic challenges and smart city projects and improve the lives of everyday citizens?

<strong>Yes, and money.</strong>

TechMill will be handing out a cash prize to the first place team, and a team pack of Google Home Minis for second place. We're expecting an increase in the cash prize (pending sponsor support) and more prizes based on implementation or project, and we'll keep the prizes up to date here.
