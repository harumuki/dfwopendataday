		<h3>Travel and Parking</h3>
		<p>Tomorrow is supposed to be a busy day at the library for other events, so parking will be at a premium if you do not get there earlier in the day. Luckily, we're starting in the morning, so most of the garage parking will be open and free. Other than that, you will be responsible for any street parking or paid parking lots around the area.</p>
		<p>If you are coming from out of town, consider carpooling! If you live downtown, consider biking or ride services - like scooters or Uber.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Location</h3>
		<p>The event will be in the Central Library - Community Showcase (1st Floor). If you walk in the door from Wood St, it is past the auditorium and to the left. If you're coming from Young St, it'll be to your right. If you're coming up the elevator, make a left at the service desk and we're right across the hall. We will have some signage to help direct as well.</p>
